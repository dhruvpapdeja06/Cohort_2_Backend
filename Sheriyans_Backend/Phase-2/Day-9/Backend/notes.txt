  
        Steps to run the application.

1. Cost Calculation to Run the Project and how to optimize it.


--> Frontend run on the different port and backend run the different Port , For cross origion we have to use
middleware at the backend that is cors.

--> If We seperate the host the website in frontend in Vercel and Backend in Render it wiil increase the Cost

Cost Calculation -->

Frontend (Vercel) --> Free for 50 concurrent User  --> Paid (200user) -- 10$Cost.

Backend (Render) --> 0.1 CPU then 10 concurrent User , if more than user then go for paid 25$/month to handle 200user.




                        (Host frontend in Backend)
Frontend  -------> npm run build --------> dist folder that is converted into HTML,CSS,JS folder.

Before 
Static (Folder inside assets publicly available) --> Public then src now it's available
