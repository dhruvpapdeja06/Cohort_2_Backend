CLUSTER => Combination of storage + Processor
DataBase (It is also one type of server.)

Cloud => MongoDB Atlas is Company (Create a lots of DB Server and placed in different location in worldwide
=> In India (Mumbai south zone) --> Take a small storage and processing to store our data here. 

Types of Server

1.Web server ==> We have create to host webpages (Apache,Nginx,IIS)
2.Mail Server 
3.Application Server ==> Host application to run .often uses middleware between client and server.
4.File Server ==> centralized storage for mulitple user.

To secure the DB we have to to layer first Network Access Layer and another one is DataBase Layer.

In Network Access Layer if DB Server in production IP is static and we have to allow only that IP.
In Developement you can allow any IP for learning Purpose becuase your IP change 

In One Cluster there multiple Database we can create.
